# About the app

this is a WebApp created in order to recognise which actor is playing on a movie we are watching on tv or screen. It also can work with a direct image as an input.
For now, it only works with one movie-serie : "The Big Bang Theory" (also called TBBT) as the actor's database has only been made with "The Big Bang Theory"'s actors.

It aims at working on Streamlit Cloud,but for now Streamlit Cloud seems to be not sized enouth for DeepFace. So for now it wordk from Colab through Ngrok.
